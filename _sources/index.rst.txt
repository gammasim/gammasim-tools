What is gammasim-tools?
=======================

gammasim-tools is a prototype of a software package that provides tools and
the framework for the Simulation System of the `CTA Observatory <www.cta-observatory.org>`_

Among the main functionalities of gammasim-tools, there are:

* simulation model DB interface and management;
* simulation model parameter derivation and validation.

The design principles followed by gammasim-tools are:

* standardized interface and data products independent of the underlying software (e.g., CORSIKA, sim_telarray, GrOPTICS);
* maximizes the sharing of tools and algorithms with other DPPS subsystems (e.g., `ctapipe <https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe>`_ and calibpipe);
* I/O and reporting tools for the MC simulation model parameter and production database.
